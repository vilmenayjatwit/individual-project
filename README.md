Data Science Individual Project

_Introduction –_

This report goes into the streaming trends of artists on Spotify in 2023, exploring various aspects and using questions to give us a better understanding of the data. Throughout this report I will describe key insights into streaming trends, highlighting the importance of various factors in an artist's streaming success. I will also propose future research discussions, such as applying more sophisticated statistical models and exploring trends over different time periods or across various streaming platforms.

_Datasets-_

The data we used was from Kaggle and was thoroughly checked to make sure they were reliable datasets. The primary datasets used for the projects are "Artists.csv", which contained all artists data including rank, streams, genre, and popularity. The other dataset used was "Spotify-2023songs.csv", which contained song popularity, artist, danceability, genre, and year. The data was imported, cleaned, and then used for analysis.

_Methodology –_

1. Data Import and Preprocessing: Loading data from CSV files and cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Data Sorting/Filtering: Organizing data based on criteria like streams and selecting relevant subsets for specific analyses.
3. Data Visualization: Utilizing bar charts for visualizing most-streamed artists and daily streams, pie charts for genre distribution, and scatter plots to examine the relationship between song features and streaming numbers.
4. Analytical Techniques: Applying lines to bar graphs and scatter plots to highline and illustrate the correlations between different data plots.

_Discussion –_

- Potential Inconsistencies
- Suggestions for Artists and Record Labels
- Broader Dataset Inclusion
- Cross-Referencing charts
