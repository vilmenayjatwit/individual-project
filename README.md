Individual Project Report 

_Introduction –_

This report presents a detailed examination of the performance trends of NBA players during the 2022-2023 regular season. By utilizing comprehensive player statistics, we aim to reveal patterns and key performance indicators that highlight the abilities and contributions of players in various positions. The insights gained from this analysis will not only be valuable for sports analysts and enthusiasts but also provide strategic input for team management and coaching staff ¹²³.

_Datasets-_

I got the dataset from Kaggle and the set used for analysis was, “2022-2023 NBA Player Stats - Regular.csv”. This dataset includes a broad range of player statistics, such as age, team, steals, blocks, turnovers, points, etc. The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and processed to ensure its accuracy and relevance for the analysis.

_Questions -_

1. Which player averaged the most amount of points in the 2022-23 NBA season?
2. Which position averages the most points per game?
3. How does age affect scoring ability?
4. Which team has the most points?
5. Are any of the top 

_Methodology –_

Data Import and Preprocessing: We imported the NBA player stats from the “2022-2023 NBA Player Stats - Regular.csv” file and preprocessed the data for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: We conducted detailed statistical analyses to understand player performance metrics.
Data Visualization: We employed various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar graphs to illustrate player performance across different metrics.
Correlation Analysis: We used statistical methods like Pearson correlation to explore the relationships between different performance indicators

_Results -_ 

Throughout the project, there were a lot of interesting findings- including a connection between a player's age and performance metrics such as scoring efficiency and defensive skills. Position-specific patterns were evident, with centers and forwards excelling in rebounds and blocks, while guards led in assists and steals. Teams with higher averages in assists and field goal percentages generally ranked better, underscoring the value of teamwork and shot selection. A comparative analysis revealed an increasing trend in three-point attempts and makes, reflecting an evolving league strategy. 

_Discussion (potential improvements)–_
